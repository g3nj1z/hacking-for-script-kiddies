## Why use it?

When I started this project, I didn't know about absolutely anything, didn't know Coding or even Hacking.

![Absolutely Nothing](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/1c/1c83e1c0388b35d43f2401543c9e214fb31892cec0d3966c7fe11955b5efe18f.jpg)

It's a long plan. It may take you years. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.

## How to use it?

Open any repositories that you interested and *read* it, It's already have guide on how to tackle the topics.
